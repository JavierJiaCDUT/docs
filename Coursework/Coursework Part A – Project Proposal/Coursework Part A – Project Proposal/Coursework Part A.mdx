## Report Sections:

### **Section 1: Title and Description (6 marks)**

Briefly explain what your final product will be like. Imagine you’re sharing your awesome idea with a marketing team—keep it simple and exciting!

**Key Questions to Answer**:

1. **What** will your product do? Describe its main purpose.
2. **How** will it work? Give a basic idea of how it functions.
3. **Who** would want to buy it? Think about your target customers.

Remember, keep your description short and to the point—no more than 200 words.

 

### **Section 2:** **Background Research (6 marks)**

This section focuses on the research that will shape your product development. You need to explore the area your product belongs to (the domain) and examine existing products in that area.

What to Include:

1. Identify and describe the main features of the domain (the area or field) your product belongs to.
2. Provide a summary of existing products similar to what you want to create. This could include looking at your competitors or analyzing data about the products.
3. Support your analysis with evidence: Include relevant reports, data, or research that backs up your findings. The more evidence you provide, the stronger your research will be.

*Example: If you’re designing a wearable device for runners, you need to understand how and where runners would use it, as well as what similar devices are already on the market.*

 

Word Limit: Keep your research summary to a maximum of 400 words.

 

### **Section 3:** **Summary of Technologies (8 marks)**

Provide a summary of the technologies you plan to use for developing your product. This should include any necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure. Make sure to cover the entire development process, from initial planning to final implementation.

**What to Include**:

**1.**   **Hardware** (if needed): Describe any physical components or devices that will be part of your product.

**2.**   **Software**: Detail the software tools, languages, or platforms you’ll use.

**3.**   **Infrastructure**: Explain the systems or networks that will support your product’s development and operation.

**Development Methodology**:

1. Describe the **research and development methodology** you will follow. This could include the software development model, methods for gathering requirements, and the processes for testing and evaluation.
2. **Choose a methodology** that best fits your project idea. Explain why this approach is the most suitable for your product. For example, Agile may be a good choice if your project requires flexibility, while Waterfall might suit a more structured and linear process.

 

Your summary should be no more than 500 words and should be supported by appropriate diagrams to illustrate your plan.

 

### **Section 4:** **Professional Issues (4 marks)**

In this section, you will identify and discuss the Legal, Social, and Ethical issues related to your project.

Stakeholder Analysis:

1. Identify the key stakeholders involved in your project, including yourself as the developer.
2. Describe the interests of each stakeholder—consider their rights, expectations, desires, and responsibilities.

Alternative Actions and Consequences:

1. Consider three possible alternative actions or demands that could come from any of these stakeholders.
2. Imagine the potential consequences of these actions, both positive and negative.

Ethical Evaluation:

1. Evaluate these actions and consequences using basic ethical values such as honesty, fairness, trust, respect, and kindness.

**Apply the following ethical tests to your evaluation:**

**1.**   **Harm Test: Do the benefits of this action outweigh any potential harm, both in the short term and long term?**

**2.**   **Legality Test: Would this action violate any laws or regulations?**

**3.**   **Colleague Test: How would your professional colleagues view this action? Would they approve?**

 

*Refer to professional codes of conduct, such as those from BCS (British Computer Society) or ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), to guide your evaluation.*

 

Word Limit: Keep your discussion within 200 words.

 

<u>**Example for you to refer:**</u>

Example: Harm Test Evaluation

\-     Imagine you are developing a mobile application that collects user data for personalized content recommendations. Your stakeholders include users, advertisers, and your development team.

Stakeholder Interests:

\-     Users: Expect personalized content recommendations for a better user experience. They also have concerns about their data privacy.

\-     Advertisers: Want access to user data for targeted advertising, which can increase revenue.

\-     Development Team: Interested in creating a successful app while adhering to ethical principles.

Alternative Action: Sharing User Data with Advertisers

\-     One possible action is to share user data with advertisers to enhance targeted advertising. This could lead to increased revenue for the project.

Consequences:

\-     Benefits: Advertisers may see improved ad targeting and increased revenue.

\-     Harms (Short-term): Users may feel their privacy is compromised, leading to trust issues and potential app abandonment.

\-     Harms (Long-term): Ongoing privacy concerns could result in reputational damage, loss of user trust, and even legal repercussions.

 

### **Section 5:** **Project Team Requirements** **(6 marks)**

If you were hiring a team to work on your project, what criteria would you use to select people to the role of developer? 

You should use your findings from Summary of Technologies above to determine the skills required to complete all aspects of the project, including both the technical skills and the transferable skills that you would want team members to possess. As with all recruitment processes, you need to consider the likely skill set of applicants and be realistic with your requirements. 

 

Word count should be about 200 words and include at least 2 technical and 2 transferable skills.
