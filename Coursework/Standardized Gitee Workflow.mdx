# Standardized Gitee Workflow

## 1. Branch Management

### Main Branch (master):

- Used only for releasing **stable versions** of the code.
- No direct commits are allowed; updates are made only by merging other branches (**Merge Request**).

### Personal Branch (feature/StudentName_FeatureDescription):

Each student creates their own branch from the `Main` Branch named in the format `feature/StudentName_FeatureDescription`.

- Example: `feature/John_UserLogin`.
- The results of each Sprintâ€™s work are pushed to the personal branch.
- **Never submit code on behalf of your classmates.**

------

# 2. Commit Message Convention

**Format:**	

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Type (Required):**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `style`: Code formatting (e.g., spaces, indentation, no functional changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `chore`: Miscellaneous tasks (e.g., build tools, dependency updates)

**Scope (Optional):**

- Describes the scope of the code changes, such as a module or file name.

**Description (Required):**

- Briefly describe the changes in the commit, in English.

**Examples:**

- `feat(user): Add user login functionality`
- `fix(login): Fix styling issue on login page`
- `docs(readme): Update project README file`

------

## 3. Merge Request (MR) Process

### Create MR:

- When the feature on the personal branch is complete, the student creates an MR to merge their branch into the `Master` branch.
- MR title format: `[Sprint X] StudentName_FeatureDescription`, e.g., `[Sprint 3] John_UserLogin`.

- **MR Template:**
  The following template is mandatory:

```
## Feature Description
[Briefly describe the functionality implemented or the issue fixed in this MR]

## Test Evidence
[Attach test screenshots to prove the functionality works]

## Related Issue
[If there is a related Issue, link it here]

## Notes
[Any additional comments]
```

### Code Review:

- Each MR must be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers (Code Review).
- Only after approval can the code be merged into the `Master` branch..

### Testing Requirements:

- Each MR must include test evidence (screenshots or videos) to prove the functionality works.

------

## 4. Release Process

**At the end of each Sprint:**

- Merge the personal branches into the `master` branch to release a stable version.
- Ensure all features are tested and there are no critical bugs before merging.

**Regular Branch Cleanup:**

- Clean up merged personal branches at the end of each Sprint to avoid branch clutter.

**Conflict Resolution:**

- Students should pull the latest code from the `Master` branch before submitting their code to resolve potential conflicts.
- If conflicts are complex, the Module Leader/AI Tools can provide guidance.

### Example Workflow

**Student John develops the user login feature:**

1. Create branch: `feature/John_UserLogin`
2. Commit code: `feat(user): Add user login functionality`
3. Create MR: `[Sprint 4] John_UserLogin`, attach test screenshots and feature description.
4. After code review, merge into the `Master` branch.
