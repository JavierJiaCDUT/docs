At OBU and CDUT we want our students to experience the full benefits of their time with us. 

These benefits include the positive impact that attending and engaging with your teaching and learning environment have on your academic success and personal development. 

We want to be able to support you and extend a helping hand but we also need to know when that support may be needed. 

**Monitoring your attendance and engagement will enable us to reach out to you,** enabling us to provide tailored assistance, helping you flourish academically and personally, and ensuring you make the most of your time here at Oxford Brookes and Chengdu University of Technology.



**Ultimately you are adult learners, and the extent to which you engage is largely your choice.** 

We expect students to attend and engage with all learning and research activities, complete all assessments, work to agreed deadlines and take responsibility for your learning, and there is extensive research literature to evidence that doing this offers you the best chance of success.

We recognise however, that sometimes engaging fully might be difficult, and while we know that many of you will recognise when your engagement dips, and will come to us for support, weknow that reaching out might not be something everyone feels confident in doing. 

We therefore want to try and offer support early, if we believe that your engagement is not sufficient to allow you to succeed and that you havenâ€™t reached out to us.

### Improving Your Engagement Levels

Your Academic Advisor will be able to discuss with you any concerns or barriers that you feel that you might have to your engagement or if you want to discuss ways in which you can improve your engagement levels (both in terms of quantity and quality).

It is important to remember that you have a role to play in maximising your University experience, and you will need to take responsibility for engaging as best you can. We will be there to support you, but this is a partnership wherein both you and the University need to make a contribution.

### Expectations

Engagement covers a multitude of ways in which students can interact with the University. 

Below is a list of some of the key ways in which students can engage, this list is not exhaustive:

- Attendance and participation in timetabled teaching activities (lectures, laboratory classes, seminars etc)
- Attendance at activities such as work placements, fieldwork, dissertation supervision sessions, studio work
- Completion of individual and/or group assessment tasks - event assessments (exams, presentations, quizzes etc), coursework, practical assessments / performances
- Library: Use of electronic and physical resources, including books
- Meetings with Academic Advisors
- Meetings with other programme and/or module staff



**The University expects all students to engage fully with their programme of study**, and while it is recognised that students will have commitments and interests outside of their studies, it is expected that students will apply the necessary level of commitment to their programme of study - which includes the necessary independent learning in which students will need to engage.



**Expectations about how students engage will vary depending on their programme of study.** Students should consult their programme handbook and module guides for guidance on the likely time that will be required to dedicate to various activities designed to meet the learning outcomes, but should note that these will only ever be guides, as a minimum baseline of what students should expect.



**Everyone will approach their learning in the way that suits them best, and this may vary as their learning techniques evolve over time.** This is why we do not set a prescribed engagement measure to ensure success. Throughout this policy we will refer to 'minimum levels of engagement'. This means if a student demonstrates one or more minimum levels of engagement, the University will use these levels when we are deciding how we can best support that student.
