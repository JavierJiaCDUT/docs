| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ethical** use where the student is still the author of the assignment | Relying on AI tools for a significant part of the assignment | **Unethical** use where the student is no longer the author of the assignment |
| **Transparent** use where the student makes clear where and how they have used AI in their assignment | Not making all use of AI tools clear                         | **Deceptive, hidden use** where the student uses AI but does not declare it with their assignment |
| Helping the student **get started** with the assignment with planning or ideas | Using AI tools to generate a part of the assignment          | Putting **the whole assignment task** into an Artificial Intelligence tool and using what is generated with little or no changes |
| Helping the student **with small changes** in the development of their assignment such as correcting spelling | Using AI for a lot of the development of an assignment       | Asking an AI tool to **generate a reference list** instead of the student doing research |
| Helping the student with **proofreading**/checking before submission of the assignment | Using AI to re-write an assignment at the final stage        | Using AI tools to answer **exam questions**                  |
| Using AI tools **with instruction or guidance from the tutor** | Using AI in ways the tutor has not recommended               | Using AI when the assignment instructions state that **AI must not be used** |
